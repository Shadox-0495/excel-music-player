# Excel-music-player
A scheduled music player made in Microsoft Excel. The player is programmed to play songs assigned to the playlist but only during specific time slots designated in the playlist configuration.

## Explanation
Why you may ask, well the short answer is because you can, the long answer there was a need to play specific gender of music throught the day, and since tehre was no access to visual studio I improvise something in Excel and this was the result.
